#Been There, Done That 

##Overview:

Been There, Done That is a web app that solves monotony and helps people try new places and things (including but not limited to fitness studios, coffee shops, restaurants, parks, outdoor activities, etc). After creating a login, users can apply the GPS functionality or type in a location to explore options. If a user has already "been there" they can click the been there button, and they will receive new result(s). The search results are based on top ranked (at least 3 stars) from Yelp and proximity to the location. For example, if a user was searching for chinese restaurants in London, and they have already been to that chinese restaurant they can click "been there" and they will receive a new search result. In addition, it will be saved to the server, so if the user was looking for chinese restaurants on a future session, the chinese restaurant that they have been to will not appear. Furthermore, the archive allows users to review previous search queries, find similar businesses, and receive unique results.
